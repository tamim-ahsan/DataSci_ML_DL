Within this repo, I am storing scripts as I explore the following three topics -
1. Data Science
2. Machine learning
3. Deep learning

I am keeping them in the same repo as these topics are related to one another. Although deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, I have created separated directories for them considering the importance of various deep learning architectures.
